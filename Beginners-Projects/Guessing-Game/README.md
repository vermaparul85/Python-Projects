# Project 1 - Guessing Game
* This program picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. 
* The rules are:
1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say "OUT OF BOUNDS"
2. On a player's first turn, if their guess is
   <br> within 10 of the number, return "WARM!"
   <br> further than 10 away from the number, return "COLD!"
3. On all subsequent turns, if a guess is 
   <br> closer to the number than the previous guess return "WARMER!"
   <br> farther from the number than the previous guess, return "COLDER!"
4. When the player's guess equals the number, it tells them, they've guessed correctly *and* how many guesses it took!
